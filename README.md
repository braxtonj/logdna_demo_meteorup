[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/ "Meteor Platform") is a JavaScript framework that combines front and back ends in to one seamless developer experience.  [LogDNA](https://logdna.com "LogDNA") is an architecturally agnostic way to handle your logging needs via numerous routes from [Docker](https://docs.logdna.com/docs/docker "LogDNA Docker Documentation") dameonsets and our [Kubernetes Agent](https://docs.logdna.com/docs/logdna-agent-v2-for-kubernetes "LogDNA Kubernetes Agent Documentation") to [Syslog](https://docs.logdna.com/docs/syslog "LogDNA Syslog Documentation") to [code libraries](https://docs.logdna.com/docs/code-libraries "LogDNA Code Libraries Documentation") and [REST](https://docs.logdna.com/reference#logsingest "LogDNA REST API Documentation").  Whatever way you’d like to handle logging, we’ve got you.

To illustrate let’s say you are using the popular deployment tool Meteor Up to push to development, staging or production.  Using [Meteor’s Todo Vue app](https://github.com/meteor/simple-todos-vue) deployed using [Meteor Up](http://meteor-up.com/), this repo shows how to send logs to [LogDNA](https://logdna.com "LogDNA") via [Syslog](https://docs.logdna.com/docs/syslog "LogDNA Syslog Documentation").  By watching console.log and console.error, the Syslog Docker logging-driver is able to forward all logs securely to our servers for ingestion and parsing.  Allowing you to gain structure from the in-structured and insights into anything.
